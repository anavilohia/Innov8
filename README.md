## Project

LiveSched:

A versatile scheduling and resource management service tailored to handle the complex needs of diverse industries, including but not limited to healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics. By dynamically adjusting schedules based on real-time data, specifications, and prioritization rules, LiveSched optimizes operations, maximizes resource utilization, and enhances client service delivery.

## Installation

This ReadMe has been tested using a Mac, please make changes as needed for Windows.

To build and use this service you must install the following:

1. [Maven 3.9.5](https://maven.apache.org/docs/3.9.5/release-notes.html)
2. [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
3. [IntelliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=mac) (Recommended IDE, optionally you may use any other)
4. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository using git clone or IntelliJ

---

## Building and Running a Local Instance

To set up and run the repository after installation, you can use the following commands inside LiveSched folder.
By default, the service operates in local mode, saving and loading files from local storage.
If you would like to use Google Cloud Storage (GCS), you can enable GCS operations by passing the `--useGCS` flag as noted below.
But please note that if you plan to run the service with GCS enabled, you need to install and set up [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk).

### Switch to code directory from root

```
cd LiveSched
```

### Setup

If you want to optionally set up an example database for the first time or want to reset it, run the following command:

```
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="setup"
```

This will set up an example database for client ID: demoClientId.

If you want to enable GCS during setup:

```
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="setup --useGCS"
```

### Run

To run the service normally (in local mode by default):

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

If you want to enable GCS operations:

```
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="--useGCS"
```

### Build and test

```
mvn -B clean install --file pom.xml
```

### Test

All unit tests are located under the directory src/test

They can be run individually in IntelliJ using right click on the test files or to run the whole test suite use the following command:

```
mvn clean test
```

### Check style issues

```
mvn checkstyle:check
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
```

### Generate code coverage result

The results can be found under target/site/jacoco directory

```
mvn jacoco:report
```

### Run and generate static bug finder results

```
mvn pmd:check
```

## Running a Cloud based Instance

This service is currently available as a google cloud based instance that can be accessed using the following url:

https://innov8-livesched.ue.r.appspot.com

A successful connection should lead you to a homepage that displays the following message:

<img width="991" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-18 at 11 47 37â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/595f76e7-22b3-47d3-99fd-951f13822dd8">

Additional data requests and tests can be made using a service like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) using the following format:

https://innov8-livesched.ue.r.appspot.com/endpoint?arg=value&arg=value

Note:
For the cloud based instance, GCS operations are enabled by default, meaning the service will load and save files to Google Cloud Storage without any additional configuration.
